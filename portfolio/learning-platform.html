          <h3>The Brief</h3>
          <p>As the saying goes, "Everyone hates their LMS" (Learning Management System). GovLoop needed to deliver and track
            hundreds of microlearning experiences for their thousands of users. So rather than licensing an off-the-shelf
            LMS we would grow to hate, we built our own.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section">

          <h3>Objective</h3>

          <p>Design and build a lightweight Learning Management System (LMS) to deliver and track hundreds of microlearning
            experiences for GovLoop's thousands of users and government clients alike.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section">
          <h3>My Role</h3>
          <h4>Learning Experience Designer & Software Engineer</h4>
          <p>I worked on the GovLoop Learning Platform over the course of three years. Initially, my contributions to the project
            consisted of Learning Experience Design, working to answer key questions about our users and developing strategies
            for pleasing them. After two years, I moved into a Software Engineering role, taking a more hands-on approach
            to designing and developing features.</p>

          <h3>The Story</h3>
          <p>At the outset of the project, we had to answer some foundational questions:</p>
          <div class="questions d-flex flex-column flex-md-row text-left mx-auto">
            <div class="question col-12 col-md-4">
              <p class="inline-block">
                <span class="count d-inline-block">1</span>
                <strong> Who are our users and what do they need?</strong>
              </p>
              <p class="follow-up">
                <em>What are their primary motivations, frustrations, and preferred modes of learning?</em>
                <p>
            </div>
            <div class="question col-12 col-md-4">
              <p>
                <span class="count">2</span>
                <strong>What is a 'GovLoop Learning Experience?'</strong>
              </p>
              <p class="follow-up">
                <em>How do we build a uniform, consistent marriage between learning content and platform experiences?</em>
                <p>
            </div>
            <div class="question col-12 col-md-4">
              <p>
                <span class="count">3</span>
                <strong>How do we change users' expectations of elearning?</strong>
              </p>
              <p class="follow-up">
                <em>Why is their view of online learning so poor, and what are we going to do differently to raise expectations?</em>
                <p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            We took a service design approach to answering these questions, conducting user interviews & focus groups, structured design
            thinking activities (i.e. "Gamestorming"), and rapid prototyping. While these activities were certainly a team-based
            effort, my contribution came primarily in the form of strategic planning and facilitation of many of the activities.
            In addition, I led the effort to distill our observations into actionalable design insights.</p>

            <p>From those insights, we developed data-driven user personas, user journey maps, and UI wireframes. Perhaps most
              importantly, we developed a system of design constraints and requirements ensure consistency across our learning
              products.</p>

        <h3>Outcomes</h3>

        <p>Powered by WordPress and LearnDash to track learning experiences via the Experience API (xAPI),
          <a href="https://academy.govloop.com/" target="_blank">GovLoop Academy</a>
          was launched in April 2014 with 25 courses available for free to the GovLoop community. With this successful launch, government clients (who presumably hated their LMSes) started to ask if they could license our platform
          for their own internal projects</p><p>As a result, the Learning Platform has hosted training and mentoring programs for nearly a dozen
          government agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Small Business Administration, and
          the U.S. Department of Transportation.
