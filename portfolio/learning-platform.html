            <h3>The Brief</h3>
            <p>As the saying goes, "Everyone hates their LMS" (Learning Management System). GovLoop needed to deliver and track
              hundreds of microlearning experiences for their thousands of users. So rather than licensing an off-the-shelf
              LMS we would grow to hate, we built our own.</p>

          <h3>My Role</h3>
          <h4>Learning Experience Designer & Software Engineer</h4>
          <p>I worked on the GovLoop Learning Platform over the course of three years. Initially, my role on the project consisted
            of asking key questions about our users and forming strategies for answering those questions. With a better understanding
            of our users, I spent the next two years designing dozens of highly-interactive, bite-sized learning experiences
            hosted on our platform. Eventually, I moved into a Software Engineering role, taking a more hands-on approach
            to designing and developing platform features, including advanced reporting and content discovery.</p>

          <h3>The Story</h3>
          <p>At the outset of the project, we had to answer some foundational questions:</p>
          <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item row gla-questions">
              <div class="count col-2 col-md-1">
                <p class="d-inline-block">1</p>
              </div>
              <div class="questions col-10 col-md-11">
                <p class="question mb-1">
                  <strong> Who are our users and what do they need?</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="question">What are their primary motivations, frustrations, and preferred modes of learning?</p>
              </div>
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item row gla-questions">
              <div class="count col-2 col-md-1">
                <p>2</p>
              </div>
              <div class="questions col-10 col-md-11">
                <p class="question mb-1">
                  <strong>What is a 'GovLoop Learning Experience?'</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="question">How do we build a uniform, consistent marriage between learning content and platform experiences?</p>
              </div>
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item row gla-questions">
              <div class="count col-2 col-md-1">
                <p>3</p>
              </div>
              <div class="questions col-10 col-md-11">
                <p class="question mb-1">
                  <strong>How do we change users' expectations of elearning?</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="question">Why are our users' view of online learning so poor, and what are we going to do differently to raise expectations?</p>
              </div>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            We took a service design approach to answering these questions by conducting user interviews & focus groups, facilitating structured design
            thinking activities (e.g.
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gamestorming-Playbook-Innovators-Rulebreakers-Changemakers/dp/0596804172/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1518462858&sr=8-1&keywords=gamestorming"
              target="_blank">"Gamestorming"</a>), and rapidly prototyping design concepts. While these activities were certainly a team-based effort, my contribution
            came primarily in the form of strategic planning and facilitation of many of the activities. In addition, I led
            the effort to distill our observations into actionable design insights.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section">
          <h4 class="pt-md-0">Experience Design Guideposts</h4>
          <p>
            One of our key actionable design insights was that in order to maintain consistency, we would need 'design guideposts' to
            help point us in the right direction when making design decisions. So, we generated a series of guiding questions
           to 'unstick' ourselves throughout the design process.

          <h4>Experience Design Constraints</h4>
          <p>Along with these guidepost questions, we developed data-driven user personas, user journey maps, and UI wireframes.
            Perhaps most importantly, we setup an objective system for testing the subjective quality of our products prior
            to release. Our team agreed that in order for any learning experience to be published, it must meet all of the
            following self-imposed contraints:

          <h3>Outcomes</h3>

          <p>Powered by WordPress and LearnDash to track learning experiences via the Experience API (xAPI),
            <a href="https://academy.govloop.com/" target="_blank">GovLoop Academy</a>
            was launched in April 2014 with 25 courses available for free to the GovLoop community. With this successful launch, government
            clients started to ask if they could license our platform for their own internal
            projects
          </p>
          <p>As a result, the Learning Platform has hosted training and formal mentoring programs for nearly a dozen government agencies,
            including the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and the U.S. Department
            of Transportation.
