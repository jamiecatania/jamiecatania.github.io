      <p>It's unfortunately not uncommon for an executive to earn a reputation as out-of-touch, cold, and unaware of the challenges
        facing the boots-on-the-ground of an organization. Most executives that we spoke to are (unsurprisingly) disappointed
        by this criticism, and want to actively find ways to improve their mindful awareness as leaders.</p>

      <p>Our objective was to transform an existing tabletop leadership simulation into a realtime, mobile multiplayer experience
        that breaks down the walls around mindful awareness through real-world decision-making scenarios.</p>

      <h3>The Story</h3>
      <p>We started the project with two primary resources: (1) a three-day, in-person tabletop leadership simulation
        and (2) a team of experienced leadership coaches that have facilitated the simulation for several years. Over the course of the first few weeks of the project, we centered an intense focus on gaining empathy with the users. Among several big question, we wanted to understand:</p>
        <blockquote>As a busy executive, what was it like to walk into a room, sit down at a table, and "play a game"?</blockquote>

          </div>
        <div class="content">
        <p>To help build empathy, we dove headfirst into our resources through playtesting, detailed task analysis, and user observation. We documented every single interaction that a user might encounter throughout the three-day experience (see right), and we mapped-out every decision that a user might face (see left). Coupled with this mapping, we identified the factors that users would consider when making each decision.</p>

      <p>
        <i class="fa fa-caret-right mr-2"></i>Discussion is King. Every player interaction should lead to group discussion.</p>
      <p>
        <i class="fa fa-caret-right mr-2"></i>The experience needs to be dynamic and unpredictable, just like the real world.</p>
      <p>
        <i class="fa fa-caret-right mr-2"></i>The simulation scenarios should be authentic to to each client's unique needs.</p>

      <h3>Result</h3>
      <p>After eight months of research, design iterations, game development, and user testing, a functional minimally-viable
        product was completed and tested with live clients during three daylong pilot sessions. Early feedback indicated a
        marked improvement in 'flow'-state for users.</p>
