            <h4>User Experience (UX) Team Lead</h4>
            <p class="pt-md-0">Throughout the life of this project, I led research and design activities for a 6-person multidisciplinary team
              consisting of a project manager, two UX designers, a visual designer, and a game developer. This role consisted
              of coordination with internal stakeholders, building holisitic user research and testing strategies, and owning
              the design inputs to the final product.</p>

            <p class="ml-md-0">We started the project with two primary resources: (1) an existing, three-day in-person tabletop leadership simulation
              and (2) a team of experienced leadership coaches that have facilitated the simulation for several years. We leveraged
              these resources through playtesting, detailed task analysis, and user observation. As a result, the team grew
              to understand and appreciate every facet of the tabletop simulation that contributed to a successful user experience.</p>

            <p class="ml-md-0">Our primary finding was that only about 23% of users reported a state of 'flow', where the balance of challenge and
              success created a sense of immersion and growth. Through discussion with stakeholders, we determined that number
              to be too low, and established the definition of success for our Digital Leadership Challenge Simulation to be closer
              to 40% of users reporting a state of flow.</p>

        <h4>Key Design Insights</h4>
        <p><i class="fa fa-caret-right mr-3"></i>Discussion is King. Every single interaction should generate group discussion.</p>
        <p><i class="fa fa-caret-right mr-3"></i>The experience should be dynamic and unpredictable, just like change is in the real world.</p>
        <p><i class="fa fa-caret-right mr-3"></i>The simulation should be designed to be modular and customizable per client.</p>

        <h3>Result</h3>
        <p>After eight months of research, design iterations, game development, and user testing, a functional minimally-viable product was completed and tested with live clients during three daylong pilot sessions. Early feedback indicated a marked improvement in 'flow'-state for users.</p>

      <p>If you build it, they will come (and baby listens to what the Lord say). But I've been getting pretty worn, building
        for nearly a decade</p>

      <p>In a perfect world we shouldn’t have been allowed to lose sight of what it means to love wholly. I’ve got a Polaroid
        hanging on my wall that a friend took of me and my angel. I remember the day like it’s something I can touch, but it’s
        stuck in the square between the borders of the film, and I can run my fingers over our faces, but I can’t get back
        to the places we were</p>


      <blockquote>
        <p>You’ve got a pain deep in your bones, son.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>"You’ve got a pain deep in your bones, son. It compels you forward like you’re tied to a slave master’s cruel hand, and
        it's the same pain that drives that oppressor’s heart of stone, so you’ve grown to love the man. You keep pouring yourself
        out, again and again, into legible lines through a crooked pen." Yeah, it’s painful, but it’s familiar – so habit breeds
        comfort, and I don’t know what I’d do without him</p>

      <p>So in the early morning, when you’ve fallen asleep in our home, I drift back into the memories that I’ve claimed as my
        own, and wonder if tonight will be a night I’ll hang on my wall like I did before we stopped taking photos, out of
        the habit of being comfortable with not trying at all</p>

      <p>In a perfect world, we’ll have albums labeled Seasons, with chapter headings, and we’ll staple them to the cork-board
        that hangs at the foot of the bed. There’s longevity in a memory spilt out in pen, and if a picture is worth a thousand
        words then I’ve written down every one of them</p>

      <p>I work hard, scarred, toil through that soil for the youth I see in my friends, but these journals are moments in time,
        snapshots of our lives, and in retrospect, age is an overexposed photo that the memories can't mend</p>

      <p>I know my sweet seductress, and her name is Depression. I wrote best beneath that demon’s destructive oppression</p>


      <p>In those Polaroids, she drove the ink into the canvas like a slave beneath his master’s cruel hand, and I hated that
        whip but always wondered what I’d do without it, so I grew to love the man</p>

      <p>Oh, I wept for change! I begged for movement and the good Lord, he answered my prayers, but you don’t know how to breathe
        easy when you let go of your habits, even if your comforts left you gasping for air</p>

      <h2>Dear Time</h2>

      <p>Grandfather's as creaky as his front porch, scent like oil in the gun barrel, dip-can kicked over the railing, sandpaper
        hands stuck behind thumb tacks on my wall. I’ve got an ache in my chest for every season I miss and it gets worse when
        the snow starts to fall. There are butterflies alive in that couple’s eyes a few years since forgotten by all, and
        sometimes, if the phone starts to ring, I can still hear their wings when you call</p>

      <p>But I begged for movement and I got what I asked for, and I can picture the answer like it came yesterday. And in the
        land of the gods, I think that things are timeless, but we are still prone to decay</p>

      <p>You know I still lift up hope of certain smiles in those photos for us when I pray</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>"Idle hands build nothing that you can call your own"</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Time is a cruel lover, and she breaks her house apart at its bones. You know comfort is no good reason for standing still,
        and idle hands build nothing that you can call your own.</p>
