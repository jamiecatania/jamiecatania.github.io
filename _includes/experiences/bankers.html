                <p>The sales training team at Bankers is responsible for sales process and regulatory compliance education for
                    its nationwide, 3000+ member sales team. While with the team, I was primarily responsible for collaborating
                    with the learning management system vendor on the design of a new, central training portal. In addition,
                    I wrote and edited nearly 20 hours of online sales courseware that complied with state and federal
                    regulations.</p>
