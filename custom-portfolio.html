          <h3 class="ml-md-0">The Story</h3>
          <p class="ml-md-0">I needed a new, refreshed portfolio to house my latest work. Sure, I could have picked up a beautiful plug-and-play
            WordPress theme, paid a hosting service to setup my site with one click, and then used a plug-in to manage my content.
            But I decided to view this project as a learning opportunity. As an exercise, I wanted to write every line of code on this site, and
            I wanted to try out a few web development tools that I'd heard a lot about.</p>
          <h4>Bootstrap + Jekyll = Rapid Development</h4>

          <div class="row align-bottom">
              <div class="col-12 col-md-8">
                  <p class="mb-md-0 text-grey">
                      <strong>Tools Used:</strong>
                      <br class="d-md-none">
                      <em>Bootstrap, Jekyll, HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, jQuery, Git, Sketch</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>I chose this stack for one primary reason: rapid, lightweight prototyping. I wanted to see how quickly I could design
                      and build this site without relying on bloated, feature-rich platforms like WordPress. I didn't need a data-rich,
                      backend-heavy platform, and I didn't want to deal with things like comment spam and constant security updates.</p>

            <a href="https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">
              <strong>Bootstrap</strong>
            </a> is an HTML, CSS, and Javascript framework that allows me to quickly add simple, default-styled markup and interactivity to pages. The framework is extremely
            well-documented, and because it is so pervasive across the industry, support is nearly always one Google search
            away. As the project progressed, I found the most value in Bootstrap's built-in, 12-column grid layout.
            In particular, the grid made mobile responsiveness a breeze, reducing much of the need for CSS media queries.</p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">
              <strong>Jekyll</strong>
            </a> allows me to easily modularize markup and generate static site files. Initially, I began the project without a static site generator. However, I quickly found myself dealing with extremely long, difficult-to-navigate markup files. I needed a tool that would allow me to modularize and reuse sections of HTML. Since I wasn't generating site content dynamically on a server, a static site generator like Jekyll was my go-to option. In addition to the benefits of modularization, Jekyll operates on a templating language called Liquid. Using basic Liquid, I was able to inject custom data, like page titles and urls, into markup at compile time.</p>

            <a href="https://github.com/jamiecatania/jamiecatania.github.io" target="_blank">up on Github,</a> so go ahead and take a look!</p>
          <h4>Areas for Future Improvement</h4>
          <p><i class="fa fa-caret-right mr-3"></i>Take full advantage of Liquid syntax and Markdown to make writing new content even easier.</p>
          <p><i class="fa fa-caret-right mr-3"></i>Utilize CSS Grid and Flexbox more heavily for laying out new pages, instead of the Bootstrap grid.</p>
