              <p>Every government agency has a responsibility to focus its efforts on fulfilling the needs of its citizens. However,
                it’s unfortunately all-too-common for competing interests to shift the discussion toward internal agendas and
                interests. We designed this curriculum to introduce the concept of Human-Centered Design and its role in developing
                government products, services, and policies that put citizens and their needs at the center of decision-making.</p>

              <span class="img-desc d-none d-md-inline-block mt-2 pull-right">Detailed interaction flow chart.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="col-12 col-md-8 order-md-1">
              <p class="ml-md-0">Our primary instructional strategy revolved around storytelling. We gave Human-Centered Design (HCD) practicioners
                throughout Federal, state and local government agencies a platform to share their stories of success, failure
                and growth, to help learners break down their misconceptions about innnovation and change in government. After
                capturing these stories on video, we conducted an intensive research phase, pouring through the latest Human-Centered
                Design (HCD) resources from organizations like IDEO.org, +Acumen, and the LUMA Institute.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p class="mb-md-0">In order to push our learners from 'awareness' and 'understanding' to 'practical application', we wove highly interactive,
            hands-on activities throughout the courseware. As an example, instead of simply explaining the concept of divergence
            and rapid idea generation, we provided a sample scenario and conducted a virtual simulation of an idea generation
            exercise. Learners received custom-tailored responses to their inputs, and their ideas were implemented through
            the remainder of the lesson.</p>

          <h3>Result</h3>
          <p>Over the course of a year, we published nearly two hours of HCD content on GovLoop Academy, broken across several courses.
            Are you interested in learning a little more about HCD? Great! All courses are available on-demand and completely
            free on GovLoop Academy.</p>
