        <h3>The Brief</h3>
        <p>As the saying goes, "Everyone hates their LMS" (Learning Management System). GovLoop needed to deliver and track hundreds
          of microlearning experiences for their thousands of users. So rather than licensing an LMS we would grow to hate,
          we built our own. Powered by WordPress and LearnDash to track learning experiences via the Experience API (xAPI),
          <a href="https://academy.govloop.com/" target="_blank">GovLoop Academy</a>
          was launched in April 2014 with 25 courses available for free to the GovLoop community. Given the success of our newly-minted
          platform, government clients (who presumably hated their LMSes) started to ask if they could license our platform
          for their own internal projects. Sensing opportunity, our team jumped at the opportunity to build and implement new
          features for our clients.

        <h3>Objective</h3>
  
        <p>Design and build a lightweight Learning Management System (LMS) to deliver and track hundreds of microlearning experiences
          for GovLoop's thousands of users and government clients alike.</p>

      <h3>My Role</h3>
      <h4>Learning Experience Designer & Software Engineer</h4>
      <p>My involvement in this project consisted of two major phases, initially as a learning strategist & experience designer and
        later as a software engineer. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sub-section">
        <h3>The Story</h3>
        <p>At the outset of the project, we had to answer some foundational questions:</p>
        <div class="questions d-flex flex-column flex-md-row mx-auto">
          <div class="question col-10 col-md-4 text-left">
              <p>
                <strong>Who are our users and what do they want?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>What are their primary motivations, frustrations, and preferred modes of learning?
                <p>
          </div>
          <div class="question col-10 col-md-4 text-center">
              <p>
                <strong>What is a 'GovLoop Learning Experience?'</strong>
              </p>
              <p>How do we build a uniform, consistent marriage between content & platform experiences?
                <p>
          </div>
          <div class="question col-10 col-md-4 text-right">
              <p>
                <strong>How do we change users' expectations?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>Why is their view of online learning so poor, and what are we going to do differently?
                <p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          We took a service design approach to answering these questions, including user interviews & focus groups, structured design
          thinking activities (i.e. "Gamestorming"), and rapid prototyping. While these activities were certainly a team-based
          effort, my contribution came primarily in the form of strategic planning and facilitation of many of the activities.
          In addition, I led the effort to distill our observations into actionalable design insights. From those insights,
          we developed data-driven user personas, user journey maps, and UI wireframes. Perhaps most importantly, we developed
          a system of design goals and constraints to guide and blend design decisions between both content and platform.
