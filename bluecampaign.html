        <h3>The Brief</h3>
        <p>Simply put, human trafficking is modern-day slaver*y. Every year, men, wom*en, and children are trafficked in every
          part of the world, including here in the United States. Congress has tasked federal agencies, like the Department
          of Homeland Security, to work with private-sector partnerships to end human trafficking. As a part of this effort,
          our team collaborated with DHS' Blue Campaign to build a highly-interactive digital awareness and education campaign
          for DHS employees and members of the public.
        </p>
        <h3>Objective</h3>

        <p>Given a huge government workforce with generally low expectations for online learning, encourage trafficking awareness
          and elicit appropriate responses from DHS employees and private partners when the.</p>

          <strong>Lead Designer + Project Manager</strong>
          <br> As lead designer on the project, I worked to ensure that the program was meeting the Blue Campaign's stated objectives.
          In this role, I met weekly with our Blue Campaign clients, pitching design concepts, providing status updates, and
          answering any technical questions that arose. Internally, I managed the 4-person design/production team on a daily
          basis, collaborating with visual designers, video editors, and instructional designers.

The major design insight we took away from our research was that in order to convince people to take action, we would need to instill an emotional connection between our users and the victims of human trafficking.</p>
